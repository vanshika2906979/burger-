Step 1 – Making Pizza Dough
This recipe will make enough dough for 4 small or 3 medium sized or 2 large pizzas. It’s great for preparing ahead of time keeping in the fridge overnight for when you’re ready to use!

I have explained kneading dough with hands, but you could easily use a stand mixer.

Here’s how to make the best, easiest pizza dough from scratch:

1. First, in a large bowl mix together 1.5 teaspoons instant yeast and ½ teaspoon of sugar.

Usually instant yeast can be mixed directly in the flour or in water at room temperature. But I am detailing this method as it can be implemented if you are using dry active yeast. Add 2 teaspoons dry active yeast for this pizza crust recipe.
